# Data-visualization
This project was done in programming course in university as a final assignment. My program can visualize numerical data graphically. The program models the given numerical data and draws a line, bar or pie chart based on the user's choice. The points of the given data are determined based on (x, y) coordinates. The program also calculates the average and standard deviation of the Y-values from the data provided by the user and presents these numbers graphically to the user on the graph page with two decimal places.
The user can select the data, draw a grid on the graph and add a scaling factor to the grid, i.e. a number that determines how often the grids are drawn. In addition to this, the user can optionally add a title to the graph, legends for the X and Y axes and the scales that have been used.
When plotting, the X- and Y-axes legends and scales do not overlap and are at the correct interval for the plotted data. The accepted data format for the program is a text file (.txt), where the X and Y values are separated by a space.

The technologies I used were based on the instructions of the assignment; for instance, almost all the Python libraries were forbidden.
